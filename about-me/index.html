				<h1>history</h1>
				<article>
					Born in Boston, raised in Dubai, I found myself moving to Lebanon to live with
					my sister at 15. I had already changed schools multiple times by then,
					and was craving another change. Three years later, and here I am back where I started.

				<h1>education</h1>
				<article>
					After graduating from a high school in a rural Lebanese town, I attended
					University of Balamand for a year as a mandatory undeclared major. I kept
					telling myself I didn't want to major in anything scientific the following year,
					despite the fact that I had higher scores in my science courses. I wanted to be
					involved in art: interior design, industrial design, photography, anything...
					But I finally decided to work my strengths, and am very glad I did.

				<h1>currently</h1>
				<article>
					Today I am a Computer Science major at Framingham State University, hoping
					to work towards a minor in Physics as well. I had hardly any programming experience
					before starting the program, and have an eternity of self-teaching ahead of me.
					This summer, I am interning as a Software Engineer at Rocket Software, Inc.
					where I have taken on a challenging project that I hope to complete by fall.
